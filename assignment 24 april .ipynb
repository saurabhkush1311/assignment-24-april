Specifically, PCA seeks to identify the directions in which the data has the largest variance or spread. These directions are referred to as the principal components, and they capture the most significant patterns or features in the data. PCA finds the principal components by computing the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of the covariance matrix of the data. The eigenvectors correspond to the principal components, while the corresponding eigenvalues represent the variance of the data along those directions. By sorting the eigenvectors in decreasing order of their corresponding eigenvalues, PCA can identify the most important principal components and determine their contribution to the total variance of the data."

In this way, the principal components that have high variance will be given more importance in the analysis, while the principal components with low variance will be given less importance. This means that the high variance dimensions will be weighted more heavily in the projection of the data onto the lower-dimensional subspace. However, if the low variance dimensions contain important information that should not be discarded, it may be necessary to apply a technique called \"whitening\" to the data before performing PCA. Whitening rescales the data so that all dimensions have equal variance, which can help prevent the low variance dimensions from being ignored during the analysis."
